## New Spells

## Armor of Darkness

Abjuration \[Darkness\]

**Level:** Darkness 4

**Components:** V, S , D F

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Creature touched

**Duration:** 10 minutes/level

**Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The spell envelops the warded creature in a shroud of shadows. The shroud can, if the caster desires, conceal the wearer’s features. In any case, it grants the recipient a +3 deflection bonus to Armor Class plus an additional +1 for every four caster levels (maximum bonus +8). The subject can see through the armor as if it did not exist and is also afforded darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Finally, the subject gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against any holy, good, or light spells or effects.Undead creatures that are subjects of _armor of darkness_ also gain +4 turn resistance.

## Blacklight

Evocation \[Darkness\]

**Level:** Darkness 3, Sor/Wiz 3

**Components:** V, S , M

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area:** A 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or point in space

**Duration:** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw:** Will negates or none (object)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes or no (object)

The caster creates an area of total darkness. The darkness is impenetrable to normal vision and darkvision, but the caster can see normally within the blacklit area. Creatures outside the spell’s area, even the caster, cannot see through it.

The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary cast on a mobile object. A character can cast the spell on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. Unattended objects and points in space do not get saving throws or benefit from spell resistance.

_Blacklight_ counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level. The 3rd-level cleric spell _daylight_ counters or dispels _blacklight._

## Bolt of Glory

Evocation \[Good\]

**Level:** Glory 6

**Components:** V, S , D F

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Effect:** Ray

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell projects a bolt of energy from the Positive Energy Plane against one creature. The caster must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike the target. A creature struck suffers varying damage, depending on its nature and home plane of existence:

<table data-debug="no-caption" class="full-width-table"><tbody><tr><th>Creature’s Origin/Nature</th><th>Damage</th><th>Maximum Value</th></tr><tr><td>Material Plane, Elemental Plane, neutral outsider</td><td>1d6/2 levels</td><td>7d6</td></tr><tr><td>Negative Energy Plane, evil outsider, undead creature</td><td>1d6/level</td><td>15d6</td></tr><tr><td>Positive Energy Plane, good outsider</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Bolts of Bedevilment

Enchantment \[Mind-Affecting\]

**Level:** Madness 5

**Components:** V, S

**Casting Time:** One action

**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect:** Ray

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell grants the caster the ability to make one ray attack per round. The ray dazes one living creature, clouding its mind so that it takes no action for 1d3 rounds. The creature is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can’t move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.

## Crown of Glory

Evocation

**Level:** Glory 8

**Components:** V, S , M, D F

**Casting Time:** 1 full round

**Range:** Personal

**Area:** 120-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

**Duration:** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

The caster is imbued with an aura of celestial authority, inspiring awe in all lesser creatures.

The caster gains a +4 enhancement bonus to his or her Charisma score for the duration of the spell. All creatures with fewer than 8 HD or levels cease whatever they are doing and are compelled to pay attention to the caster. Any such creature that wants to take hostile action against the caster must make a successful Will save to do so. Any creature that does not make this saving throw the first time it attempts a hostile action is _enthralled_ for the duration of the spell (as the _enthrall_ spell), as long as it is in the spell’s area, nor will it try to leave the area on its own. Creatures with 8 HD or more may pay attention to the caster, but are not affected by this spell.

When the caster speaks, all listeners telepathically understand him or her, even if they do not understand the language. While the spell lasts, the caster can make up to three suggestions to creatures of fewer than 8 HD in range, as if using the _mass suggestion_ spell (Will save negates); creatures with 8 HD or more aren’t affected by this power. Only creatures within range at the time a _suggestion_ is given are subject to it.

_Material Component:_ worth at least 200 gp.

## Genesis

Conjuration (Creation)

**Level:** Creation 9

**Components:** V, S , M, X P

**Casting Time:** 1 week (8 hours/day)

**Range:** 180 ft.

**Effect:** A demiplane on the Ethereal Plane centered on your location

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

This spell creates an immobile, finite plane with limited access—a demi-plane.

Demiplanes created by this power are very small, minor planes. A character can cast this spell only on the Ethereal Plane. When he or she casts it, a local density fluctuation precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the demiplane grows at a rate of a 1-foot-radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as the fledgling plane draws substance from surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter or astral ectoplasm.

The character determines the environment in the demiplane when he or she first casts \_genesis,\_reflecting most any desire he or she can visualize. The caster determines factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the shape of the general terrain. However, the spell cannot create life, nor can it create construction. If desired, these must be brought in by some other fashion.

Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, the character can continue to cast this spell to enlarge the demiplane if he or she is inside the boundaries of the demiplane. In such a case, the radiusof the demiplane increases by 60 feet for each subsequent casting.

If the spell is cast again while outside an existing demi-plane, the casting creates a separate bubble that does not touch or overlap any previously created demiplane.

_XP Cost:_ 5,000 XP.

## Hardening

Transmutation

**Level:** Sor/Wiz 6, Artifice 7

**Components:** V, S

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One item of a volume no greater than 10 cu. ft./level

(see text)

**Duration:** Permanent

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

This spell increases the hardness of materials. For every two caster levels, increase by 1 the hardness of the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the material’s resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement.

The _hardening_ spell does not in any way affect resistance to other forms of transformation.

This spell affects up to 10 cubic feet per level of the spellcaster.

If cast upon a metal or mineral, the volume is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level.

## Maddening Scream

Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting\]

**Level:** Sor/Wiz 8, Madness 8

**Components:** V

**Casting Time:** One action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Living creature touched

**Duration:** 1d4+1 rounds

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

The subject cannot keep him or herself from behaving as though completely mad. This spell makes it impossible for the victim to do anything other than race about caterwauling.

The effect worsens the Armor Class of the creature by 4, makes Reflex saving throws impossible except on a roll of 20, and makes it impossible to use a shield.

## Rage

Enchantment

**Level:** Madness 3

**Components:** V, S

**Casting Time:** One action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Creature touched

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The caster can put a creature into a blood frenzy. In this rage, the creature gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. (Unlike a barbarian rage, no penalty to AC is suffered, and no fatigue period occurs after the rage is over.)

## Surelife

Abjuration

**Level:** Repose 8

**Components:** V, S, M

**Casting Time:** 1 round

**Range:** Personal

**Target:** You

**Duration:** 1 minute/2 levels

This spell allows the caster to protect him or herself against some condition that would ordinarily cause certain death. The character can only protect him or herself against a natural occurrence or condition, not against a spell or the action of a creature. The character must specify the condition against which he or she wishes to protect him or herself, and the spell is effective only against that condition. Should the character be subjected to that condition during the duration of the spell, he or she feels no discomfort and takes no damage from the condition. However, the spell does not protect any items carried on the caster’s person. At the end of the spell’s duration, the condition has full normal effects if the character is still subjected to it.

## Touch of Madness

Enchantment \[Mind-Affecting\]

**Level:** Madness 2

**Components:** V, S

**Casting Time:** One action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Creature touched

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

The caster may daze one living creature by making a successful touch attack. If the target creature does not make a successful Will save, its mind is clouded and it takes no action for 1 round per caster level. The dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can’t move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.

## True Creation

Conjuration (Creation)

**Level:** Creation 8

**Components:** V, S , M, X P

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 0 ft.

**Effect:** Unattended, nonmagical object of nonliving matter, up to

1 cu. ft./level

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

The caster creates a nonmagical, unattended object of any sort of matter. Items created are permanent and cannot be negated by dispelling magics or negating powers. For all intents and purposes, these items are completely real. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. The caster must succeed at an appropriate skill check to make a complex item.

Unlike the items brought into being by the lower-level spells _minor creation_ and _major creation,\_objects created by the casting of \_true creation_ can be used as material components.

_XP Cost:_ The item’s gold piece value in XP, or a minimum of 1 XP, whichever is more.

## Undeath to Death

Necromancy

**Level:** Sor/Wiz 6, Clr 6, Repose 6

**Components:** V, S , M, D F

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area:** Several undead creatures within a 50-ft.-radius burst

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

_Undeath to death_ snuffs out the animating forces of undead creatures, killing them instantly. The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those closest to the point of origin of the burst are affected first.

_Material Component:_ worth at least 500 gp.
