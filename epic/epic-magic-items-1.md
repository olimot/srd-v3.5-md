# EPIC MAGIC ITEMS 1

While not truly an artifact, the epic magic item is a creation of such power that it surpasses other magic items. Epic magic items are objects of great power and value. The following are typical characteristics of an epic magic item. In general, an item with even one of these characteristics is an epic magic item.

- Grants a bonus on attacks or damage greater than +5.
- Grants an enhancement bonus to armor higher than +5.
- Has a special ability with a market price modifier greater than +5.
- Grants an armor bonus of greater than +10 (not including magic armor’s enhancement bonus).
- Grants a natural armor, deflection, or resistance bonus greater than +5.
- Grants an enhancement bonus to an ability score greater than +6.
- Grants an enhancement bonus on a skill check greater than +30.
- Mimics a spell of an effective level higher than 9th.
- Has a caster level above 20th.
- Has a market price above 200,000 gp, not including material costs for armor or weapons, material component- or experience point-based costs, or additional value for intelligent items.

An epic magic item that grants a bonus beyond those allowed for normal magic itemshas a higher market price than indicated by the formulas for non-epic items.

Epic magic items are not artifacts. They are not unique, though they are certainly very rare, and anyone with the proper item creation feats can build them. Even an epic magic item can never grant a dodge bonus, and the maximum inherent bonus that can be applied to an ability score is +5. An epic magic item cannot be created that uses or mimics an epic spell. A major artifact might be able to mimic such a spell, however.

## Creating Epic Magic Items

The process of creating an epic magic item is very similar to creating a nonepic magic item. However, certain important differences exist.

## Caster Level

Spells with an effective level of 10th or higher are possible at epic levels. Because these spell slots aren’t automatically gained at a particular level like 0- to 9th-level spells are, they don’t have a minimum caster level. For this reason, the minimum caster level for any spell of 10th level or higher is set at 11 + spell level.

## Prerequisites

In addition to the materials and tools required for nonepic magic items, any epic magic item requires at least two item creation feats: the epic and nonepic version.

## Market Price

Use the guidelines for nonepic magic itemsto determine the market price of an epic magic item, with one addition: If the item gives a bonus beyond the limit allowed in for normal, nonepic magic items, multiply the portion of the market price derived from that characteristic by 10. Some epic characteristics, such as caster level, don’t trigger this multiplier.

### Experience Point Cost

The experience point cost to create an epic magic item is determined differently than for a normal magic item. For all epic magic items other than scrolls, divide the market price by 100, then add 10,000 XP to the result. The final number is the experience point cost to create the item.

For epic scrolls, divide the market price by 25 (as normal for creating a nonepic scroll), then add 1,000 XP to the result. The final number is the experience point cost to create the epic scroll.

### Magic Item Descriptions

In the following sections, each general type of magic item, such as armor or scrolls, has an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items, if any. Each magic item description and table follows the same format used for nonepic magic items. Specific exceptions are noted as necessary.

## Armor

Except when otherwise stated, epic magic armor and shields follow the rules for nonepic magic armor and shields.

There is no limit to the enhancement bonus of epic magic armor or shields, to the market price modifier of epic magic armor or shield special abilities, or to the total enhancement bonus and market price modifier of epic magic armor or shields.

### Epic Armor and Shield Base Price

To find the base price of an epic suit of magic armor or an epic magic shield, roll on Table: Armor and Shields. Note that the +6 to +10 rows apply only to armor and shields that provide an enhancement bonus of +6 to +10 or armor and shields with a single special ability whose market price modifier is +6 to +10. Magic armor and shields with a total effective bonus of +6 to +10 but that have an enhancement bonus of +5 or less and special abilities whose individual market price modifiers are +5 or less use the table for nonepic magic armorto determine price.

### Epic Armor and Shield Special Ability Descriptions

Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have special abilities, such as those detailed below and nonepic abilities. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

**Acid Warding:** The armor absorbs the first 50 points of acid damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _protection from energy; Market Price:_ +6 bonus.

**Cold Warding:** The armor absorbs the first 50 points of cold damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _protection from energy; Market Price:_ +6 bonus.

**Exceptional Arrow Deflection:** This shield functions like a _shield of arrow deflection_ except that it can deflect any type of ranged attack (including spells that require a ranged touch attack) as if it were an arrow. Any time the bearer would normally be struck by a ranged attack, he or she can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20). If the ranged attack has an enhancement bonus (or a spell level), the DC increases by that amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the attack. The bearer must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn’t count as an action.

_Caster Level:_ 23rd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_shield, wall of force; Market Price: +\_8 bonus.

**Fire Warding:** The armor absorbs the first 50 points of fire damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_protection from energy; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Great Invulnerability:** This suit of armor or shield grants the wearer damage reduction. The damage reduction can be 10/magic, 15/magic, 5/epic, or 10/epic, depending on the armor.

_Caster Level:_ 19th (10/magic), 20th (15/magic), 21st (5/epic), 22nd (10/epic); _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _stoneskin, wish,_ or \_miracle; Market Price:+\_4 bonus (10/magic),+5 bonus (15/magic),+6 bonus (5/epic),+7 bonus (10/epic).

**Great Reflection:** Any time its bearer of this shield is targeted with a spell, it automatically reflects the spell back at the caster (as the _spell turning_ spell). The wearer can lower or raise this effect as a free action (thus allowing beneficial spells in as desired).

_Caster Level:_ 25th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_spell turning; Market Price: +\_10 bonus.

**Great Spell Resistance:** This suit of armor or shield grants the wearer spell resistance. The spell resistance can be 21, 23, 25, or 27, depending on the armor.

_Caster Level:_ 21st (SR 21), 22nd (SR 23), 23rd (SR 25), 24th (SR 27); _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_spell resistance; Market Price: +\_6 bonus (SR 21), +7 bonus (SR 23), +8 bonus (SR 25), +9 bonus (SR 27).

**Infinite Arrow Deflection:** This shield functions like a _shield of arrow deflection_, though it can deflect any number of projectiles or thrown weapons each round. Any time the bearer would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he or she can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20). If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. The bearer must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn’t count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or ranged spells, can’t be deflected.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_protection from arrows, shield; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Lightning Warding:** The armor absorbs the first 50 points of lightning damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prereq-uisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_protection from energy; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Negating:** Immediately after the wearer of this armor is hit with a magic weapon, the armor casts _greater dispelling_ on the weapon. (In the case of projectile weapons, the armor casts _greater dispelling_ on the weapon that fired the projectile if it is in range. If it is out of range, the armor does nothing.) No weapon can be affected by the armor more than once per day (regardless of the success of the dispel check).

_Caster Level:_ 20th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_greater dispelling; Market Price: +\_5 bonus.

**Sonic Warding:** The armor absorbs the first 50 points of sonic damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_protection from energy; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

### Specific Armors and Shields

**Antimagic Armor:** This +_1 negating full plate armor of invulnerability_ is crafted of adamantine (and thus has damage reduction 3/–). The armor provides a –5 penalty on dispel checks made against it or its wearer.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _greater dispelling, stoneskin, wish_ or _miracle; Market Price:_ 871,500 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 436,500 gp + 18,700 XP.

**Armor of the Abyssal Horde:** This+_6 full plate armor’s_ clawed gauntlets are effectively +4 keen weapons (1d10/19–20) that afflict the target as if she had been struck by an _energy drain_ spell (Fortitude negates DC 23). The armor bestows two negative levels on any nonevil creature wearing it. These negative levels persist as long as the armor is worn and disappear when the armor is removed. The negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the armor is worn.

_Caster Level:_ 20th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be evil, _energy drain; Market Price:_ 768,260 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 385,260 gp + 17,660 XP.

**Armor of the Celestial Battalion:** This+_7 chainmail_ is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without revealing its presence. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +10, no armor check penalty, and an arcane spell failure chance of 10%. It is considered light armor, and it allows the wearer to fly at will (as the _fly_ spell). Furthermore, the wearer is at all times surrounded by a _magic circle against evil_ effect (as the spell) which, if dispelled, can be created again as a free action.

_Caster Level:_ 20th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be good, _magic circle against evil; Market Price:_ 616,300 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 308,300 gp + 16,160 XP.

**Bulwark of the Great Dragon:** This +_6 heavy shield_ bears the image of a dragon’s head. Three times per day, the bearer of the shield can command it to belch forth a breath weapon of the appropriate type. The range of this breath weapon is 80 feet (if a line) or 40 feet (if a cone). Regardless of the type, the breath weapon deals 20d6 points of damage. In addition, the shield provides the bearer with resistance 50 to the energy type that matches its breath weapon. To determine what type of _dragon shield_ is found, roll d% and consult the following table:

_Caster Level:_ 20th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _protection from energy; Market Price:_ 1,612,970 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 806,570 gp + 26,128 XP.

**Dragonskin Armor:** This+_5 full plate armor_ is crafted from the hide of a great wyrm dragon. At the wearer’s command, the armor sprouts enormous dragon wings, allowing the wearer to fly at a speed of 90 feet (clumsy) for a total of 4 hours each day. The armor also grants immunity to a specific type of energy, based on the color of dragon that supplied the armor. Roll d% on the following table to determine the color and immunity.

The wearer of the armor takes a –4 circumstance penalty on Diplomacy checks with dragons, but gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks against dragons.

## Weapons

Except when otherwise stated, epic magic weapons follow the rules for nonepic magic weapons. There is no limit to an epic magic weapon’s enhancement bonus, to the market price modifier of an epic magic weapon special ability, or to the total of an epic magic weapon’s enhancement bonus and market price modifier.

### Epic Weapon Base Price

To find the base price of an epic magic weapon, roll on Table: Weapons. Note that the +6 to +10 rows apply only to weapons that provide an enhancement bonus of +6 to +10 or weapons with a single special ability whose market price modifier is +6 to +10. Magic weapons with a total effective bonus of +6 to +10 but that have an enhancement bonus of +5 or less and special abilities whose individual market price modifiers are +5 or less use the table for nonepic magic weaponsto determine price.

### Epic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions

Most magic weapons only have enhancement bonuses. They can also have special abilities, such as those detailed below and nonepic abilities.A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

**Acidic Blast:** On command, an acidic blast weapon drips acid (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this acid splashes the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus acid damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of acid damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus acid damage upon their ammunition.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_acid fog; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Anarchic Power:** This weapon is chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. When a weapon of anarchic power strikes a lawful target, this power deals +3d6 points of bonus chaotic damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of chaotic damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the anarchic power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic anarchic special ability.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_word of chaos; Market Price: +\_8 bonus.

**Axiomatic Power:** This weapon is lawful-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damager reduction. When a weapon of axiomatic power strikes a chaotic target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus lawful damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of lawful damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic axiomatic special ability.

_Caster Level:_ 23rd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_dictum; Market Price: +\_8 bonus.

**Distant Shot:** A distant shot weapon can be used against any target within line of sight at no penalty for range.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_discern location; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Dread:** A dread weapon excels at attacking one type of creature. Against its designated foe, its effective enhancement bonus is +4 better than its normal enhancement bonus. Further, it deals +4d6 points of bonus damage against the foe, and if it scores a successful critical hit against the foe, that creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 27) or be destroyed instantly and turned to dust. (This even affects creatures immune to critical hits or death magic.) To randomly determine a dread weapon’s designated foe, roll on the following table.

_Caster Level:_ 22nd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_summon monster IX; Market Price: +\_7 bonus.

**Everdancing:** An everdancing weapon is much like a dancing weapon, though it can be loosed with a free action and will fight as long as desired. It can move up to 60 feet away from its owner. Its owner can instruct it to move to a different target as a move-equivalent action. If its owner is rendered unconscious or otherwise unable to direct it, it will fight the same opponent as long as that opponent is conscious and within range. The owner of an everdancing weapon can grasp it again as a free action (assuming it is within reach).

_Caster Level:_ 23rd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_animate objects; Market Price: +\_8 bonus.

**Fiery Blast:** On command, a fiery blast weapon is sheathed in fire (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this fire engulfs the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus fire damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of fire damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus fire damage upon their ammunition.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_fireball; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Holy Power:** This weapon is good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damager reduction. When a weapon of holy power strikes an evil target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus holy (good) damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of holy (good) damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any evil creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the holy power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic holy special ability.

_Caster Level:_ 23rd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_holy word; Market Price: +\_8 bonus.

**Icy Blast:** On command, an icy blast weapon is sheathed in icy cold (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this cold washes over the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus cold damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of cold damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus cold damage upon their ammunition.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_cone of cold; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Lightning Blast:** On command, a lightning blast weapon crackles with electrical energy (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, lightning coruscates around the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus electricity damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of electricity damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus electricity damage upon their ammunition.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_lightning bolt; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Mighty Disruption:** Any undead creature struck in combat must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 21) or be destroyed. A weapon of mighty disruption must be a bludgeoning weapon. (If this property is rolled for a piercing or slashing weapon, reroll.)

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_true resurrection; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Sonic Blast:** On command, a sonic blast weapon emits a low thrumming hum (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this becomes a thunderous roar that deals +3d6 points of bonus sonic damage to the creature struck. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of sonic damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus sonic damage upon their ammunition.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_shout; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Triple-Throw:** This special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be thrown. (If this property is rolled for a weapon that cannot be thrown, reroll.) A triple-throw weapon creates two duplicates of itself when thrown. Both the original and the duplicate weapons attack separately (at the same attack bonus). Regardless of the success of any of the attacks, the duplicates immediately disappear after the attack is completed. Any bonuses on damage due to accuracy or precision (including those from sneak attacks, the Precise Shot feat, or the ranger’s favored enemy bonus) apply only to the original weapon’s damage, not to the duplicates.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_shades; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Unerring Accuracy:** Ranged attacks made with this weapon negate the AC bonus granted by any cover short of total cover. The weapon’s ranged attacks also ignore any miss chance from concealment (including total concealment, but the must still aim his or her attacks at the correct square).

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_true seeing; Market Price: +\_6 bonus.

**Unholy Power:** This weapon is evil-aligned and this bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. When a weapon of unholy power strikes a good target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus unholy (evil) damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of unholy (evil) damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any good creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the unholy power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic unholy special ability.

_Caster Level:_ 23rd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, \_unholy word; Market Price: +\_8 bonus.

**Gripsoul:** _Gripsoul_ is a +_6 keen long-sword,_ but instead of dealing additional damage on a critical hit, the weapon imprisons the victim in a gem set in the pommel of the sword as per a _binding_ spell heightened to 16th level (DC 30). The same is true of any blow that would otherwise kill a foe or knock him or her unconscious. Only one creature can be so held, but the wielder can release the bound soul at any time with a command word.

**Quarterstaff of Alacrity:** Both ends of this +_5 quarterstaff of speed_ have equal enhancement and special powers, meaning that it allows an additional attack with each end every round.

It also deflects ranged weapons as if the wielder had the Deflect Arrows and Infinite Deflection feats.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _protection from arrows, shield; Market Price:_ 462,600 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 231,600 gp + 14,620 XP.

**Epic Psionics:** This special crystal ring comes in a variety of types useful only to psionic characters (characters who have power points per day). The wearer’s total power points per day are increased, depending on the ring. The points granted are not bonus points—while the ring is worn, it actually increases the wearer’s points per day, but a night’s rest is required before gaining access to the increased power point per day total. (Power points are not actually stored in the ring, as would be the case for a crystal capacitor. Instead, the ring grants power points by magnifying the manifester’s own power.)

A _ring of epic psionics V_ increases the wearer’s daily power points by 43 points, a _ring of epic psionics VI_ grants 63 power points, a _ring of epic psionics VII_ grants 87 power points, a _ring of epic psionics VIII_ grants 115 points, and a _ring of epic psionics IX_ grants 147 power points.

### Epic Rod Descriptions

Standard epic rods are described below.

**Besiegement:** This rod functions as a +_3 light mace._ In addition, it is useful for besieging fortifications. Whenever the wielder makes a charge attack, the rod improves to a +6 weapon. Twice per day, the rod can create a battering ram that lasts for 24 rounds. This ram can strike once per round, dealing 20 points of damage with each hit. It cannot be used to target individuals, only fortifications. It can be damaged by normal means (65 hp, AC 22), and _disintegrate_ or _dispel magic_ destroys it. The rod also has the following powers: _Siege Engine:_ One heavy catapult, two light catapults, or three siege towers may be generated with each use of this power. Each weapon created lasts for 12 hours. The power can be used three times per day. Ammunition for 20 shots is included with each weapon created.

_Transmute Rock to Mud:_ This power can be used three times per day (caster level 24th, save DC 17).

_Caster Level:_ 24th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _clenched fist, passwall, telepathic bond, transmute rock to mud; Market Price:_ 447,745 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 224,025 gp + 14,474 XP.

**Epic Absorption:** Like a _rod of absorption,_ this rod draws single-target or ray spells and spell-like abilities into itself, nullifying the effect and storing the potential spell levels until the wielder releases the energy in the form of spells of his or her own. Spells of any level (including those boosted beyond 9th level by metamagic) can be absorbed, although epic spells cannot. The rod absorbs a maximum of 150 spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged.

_Caster Level:_ 23rd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, empowered maximized _spell turning; Market Price:_ 1,500,000 gp.

**Epic Cancellation:** This rod’s touch drains an item of all magical properties, including the magical energy in epic magic items (but not most artifacts). The item touched gets a Will saving throw (DC 26). If a creature is holding the magic item at the time, then the item can use the holder’s Will save bonus in place of its own. In such cases, contact is established by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining three items, the rod becomes brittle and useless. Drained items can only be restored by _wish, miracle,_ or epic spells specifically designed to restore lost power. A _rod of epic cancellation_ can neutralize a normal _sphere of annihilation_ without itself being cancelled.

_Caster Level:_ 25th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, _dispel magic; Market Price:_ 330,000 gp.

**Epic Might:** This rod is similar to a _rod of lordly might,_ although it is far more powerful. It is larger than its normal counterpart, and it is constructed of adamantine rather than normal metal. It has six buttons, several spell-like functions, and several mundane uses, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts.

The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.

- _Dominate Person:_ Touched foe is recipient of a _dominate person_ spell, if the wielder so commands (Will save DC 24). The wielder must choose to use this power and then succeed with a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.
- _Stun:_ Upon command, all enemies viewing the rod are stunned, as per the _power word, stun_ spell (10-foot maximum range, Will save DC 24). Invoking this power is a standard action.
- _Damage:_ Upon command, the rod deals 10d8 points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack and cures the wielder of a like amount of damage (Will save DC 26). The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with _dominate person._

The following weapon uses of the rod have no limits on their use.

- In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +_6 heavy mace._
- When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +_3 longsword of fiery blasting._
- When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +_8 battleaxe._
- When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +_10 shortspear_ or +_10 longspear._

The following mundane uses of the rod also have no limits on their use.

- Climbing pole/ladder: When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 150 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 10,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5.
- The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod’s base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength bonus of +24.
- When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder a knowledge of his or her approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.

_Caster Level:_ 30th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _cure critical wounds, inflict critical wounds, bull’s strength, fireball, dominate person, power word stun; Market Price:_ 4,293,432 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 2,151,372 gp + 52,841 XP.

**Epic Negation:** This rod negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items, including epic magic items (but not artifacts). The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray negates any currently active item function and has a 75% chance to negate any other spell or spell-like functions of that device, regardless of the level or power of the functions, for 2d4 rounds. To negate instantaneous effects, the rod wielder needs to have readied an action. The target item gets no saving throw or means to resist this effect. The rod can function three times per day.

_Caster Level:_ 24th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, _dispel magic, limited wish_ or _miracle; Market Price:_ 446,000 gp.

**Epic Rulership:** This rod appears to be a royal scepter worth at least 25,000 gp in materials and work-manship alone. The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 360 feet when he or she activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 900 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 17 or higher are entitled to a Will saving throw (DC 29) to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if he or she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be used for 1,500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous.

_Caster Level:_ 25th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened _mass charm; Market Price:_ 575,000 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 300,000 gp + 15,500 XP.

**Epic Spellcaster:** This magnificent adamantine rod grants its wielder a +10 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks made to cast epic spells for as long as he or she holds or carries the rod.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod; _Market Price:_ 245,400 gp.

**Epic Splendor:** This rod grants its wielder a +8 enhancement bonus to Charisma for as long as he or she holds or carries the item. Three times per day, the rod creates and garbs him or her in clothing of the finest fabrics, plus adornments of fur and jewels. Apparel created by the rod can remain in existence up to 24 hours. The value of the garb ranges from 70,000 to 100,000 gp (1d4+6 x10,000 gp)—10,000 gp for the fabric, 50,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for jewel trim (maximum of 40 gems, maximum value 1,000 gp each). In addition, the rod can, once per week, create a palatial mansion in any floor plan the user desires. The mansion is palatial, able to accommodate up to 250 people, housing them in private chambers and serving them fine banquets. The mansion lasts for three days, after which time it, and everything originally in it (including items removed from the mansion), disappear.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, _fabricate, mage’s magnificent mansion; Market Price:_ 297,400 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 191,200 gp + 12,124 XP.

**Excellent Magic:** Once per day when casting a nonepic or epic spell that has an experience point component, the rod supplies up to 2,000 XP, not the caster. If more experience points are required to cast the spell, the caster provides them. As a special use of the rod, the caster can substitute the power inherent in the rod for the experience point development cost of an epic spell. Doing so drains all the power from the rod, rendering it useless.

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod; _Market Price:_ 650,000 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 325,000 gp + 26,000 XP.

**Fortification:** This rod functions as a +_3 light mace._ In addition, it is useful for the construction and defense of fortifications. Whenever the wielder is benefiting from cover, the rod improves that to nine-tenths cover (+10 cover AC bonus and +4 cover Reflex save bonus; failure on the save results in half damage and success results in no damage). Three times per day, the rod can create food and water, as per the cleric spell, for twenty-four people. The rod also has the following powers: _Fortify:_ Four times per day, a stone wall can be created that is 12 inches thick, 10 feet high, and 30 feet long. This wall has a parapet and battlements across the top. (Alternatively, the power can be used to mend a broken existing wall. The gap to be filled can be no more than 300 square feet in area.) In addition, once per day, a great door of iron can be created that is set into one of the newly created walls. This door, 4 inches thick, may be a double door, a drawbridge, or a portcullis, as chosen by the wielder. _Siege Engine:_ One heavy catapult, two light catapults, or three ballistae may be generated with each use of this power. The power can be used four times per day. Ammunition for 20 shots is included with each weapon created.

_Caster Level:_ 24th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _inter-posing hand, create food and water, major creation, wall of iron, wall of stone; Market Price:_ 465,665 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 231,985 gp + 14,634 XP.

**Invulnerability:** When held, this rod grants its wielder the following powers.

- +5 enhancement bonus to natural armor.
- +5 resistance bonus on saving throws.
- Damage reduction 15/adamantine.
- Immunity to critical hits.
- Spell resistance 32.

_Caster Level:_ 20th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, _iron body, resistance, spell resistance; Market Price:_ 600,000 gp.

**Nightmares:** Anyone who comes within 20 feet of the wielder of this rod feels a grave sense of unease. Each person so affected must make a Will save (DC 17) or suffer the effects of a _nightmare_ spell the next time he or she falls asleep. The wielder is immune to this effect. Three times per day, the wielder can utter a command word that causes the rod to emit a horrid, inhuman scream. Up to twenty of the closest creatures within a 30-foot radius who hear this terrible wail believe that their worst nightmares have become reality and suffer the effects of a _wail of the banshee_ spell (DC 23).

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, _nightmare, permanency, wail of the banshee; Market Price:_ 284,000 gp.

**Paradise:** This item creates a nondimensional space, similar in effect to a \_rod of security.\_However, the rod’s possessor and up to 999 other creatures can stay in complete safety for up to 1,000 days divided by the number of creatures affected. Natural healing takes place at five times the normal pace. The rod functions like its nonepic counterpart in all other ways.

_Caster Level:_ 24th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened _gate; Market Price:_ 610,000 gp.

**The Path:** This rod serves as an aid to trailblazing and travel. It grants the wielder a +30 enhancement bonus on Wilderness Lore checks for tracking and Intuit Direction checks. The handle of the rod is hollow, functioning like a telescope. When the wielder peers through it, the limits of vision are three times normal (and spotting distances for encounters are tripled). In addition, the telescoping handle enables the wielder to view things as though affected by a _true seeing_ spell. The rod also has the following powers. _Map:_ Three times per day a section of the rod unrolls like a scroll from a tube, revealing a map of the surrounding area, centered on the location of the rod. The area shown on the map covers an area as small as 50 feet in radius to as large as 24 miles in radius, zooming in or out with a set of command words. The map reveals natural topography and all types of structures (even hidden ones), but it will not show the location of creatures.

_Passage:_ Three times per day, this power allows the wielder and up to five others in a 20-foot radius to move unhindered through natural plant growth or bodies of water (as per the _freedom of movement_ spell).

_Bridge:_ Once per day, this power allows the user to create a 5-foot-wide, 40-foot-long stone cause-way across chasms and canyons. The bridge created lasts for 1 hour.

_Pass without Trace:_ Once per day, this power can be used on the wielder and twenty others, for 21 minutes. It is otherwise as the spell of the same name (caster level 24th).

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, _find the path, freedom of movement, pass without trace, wall of stone; Market Price:_ 306,870 gp.

**Restless Death:** The holder of this rod can rebuke or control undead as if he or she were four levels higher. (The rod doesn’t grant the ability to rebuke or control undead if the holder doesn’t already have it.) In addition, the wielder may speak a command word to cast _animate dead_. Any skeletons or zombies animated by the rod’s power are automatically controlled by the rod, up to the rod’s maximum limit of 42 HD, and they follow the orders of the rod’s wielder. These undead don’t count toward the wielder’s limit of controlled undead. Finally, the wielder can speak a second command word to cast _slay living_ (heightened to 10th level; DC 25).

_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, _animate dead, control undead, slay living; Market Price:_ 625,000 gp.

**Wyrm:** Any of the various rods in this series functions as a +_5 quarterstaff._ Upon casting the rod to the ground (a standard action) and uttering a command word, the rod grows into a specific type of dragon (depending on the specific type of rod) by the end of the round. The dragon created is a wyrm and obeys the commands of the owner. The dragon returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 500 feet from the owner. If the dragon form is slain, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated again for three days. A _wyrm rod_ only functions if the possessor is of the same alignment as the dragon type.

_Caster Level:_ 34th (white or brass), 35th (black or copper), 36th (green or bronze), 37th (blue or silver), 38th (red or gold); _Prerequisites:_ Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened _polymorph,_ creator must be same alignment as dragon type; _Market Price:_ 1,458,200 gp (brass or white), 1,562,600 gp (black or copper), 1,670,600 gp (bronze or green), 1,782,200 gp (blue or silver), 1,897,400 gp (gold or red); _Cost to Create:_ 729,400 gp + 24,576 XP (brass or white), 781,600 gp + 25,620 XP (black or copper), 835,600 gp + 26,700 XP (bronze or green), 891,400 gp + 27,816 XP (blue or silver), 949,000 gp + 28,968 XP (gold or red).
