To qualify to become an agent retriever, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

**Alignment:** Any lawful.

**Skills:** Gather Information 24 ranks, Knowledge (the planes) 15 ranks.

**Feats:** Track.

### Class Skills

### Class Features

The following are class features of the agent retriever prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** An agent retriever gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

**Spells per Day/Spells Known:** At each agent retriever level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he or she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster, the character gains only the benefit noted under the Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an agent retriever, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day.

**_Uncanny Location_ (Sp):** When a agent retriever spends one day attuning him or herself to a person or object he or she is seeking, he or she automatically determines that person’s or item’s location as the _discern location_ spell. Once he or she has established a sense of the location, the agent retriever can maintain this uncanny link even if the target moves, but only so long as he or she hunts down this person or item to the exclusion of all other pursuits. If he or she ever turns aside to undertake a second pursuit, the _uncanny location_ ends, and the agent retriever must spend another day to reattune him or herself to the target.

**Tracking Bonus (Ex):** The agent retriever gains a +10 insight bonus on Wilderness Lore checks to track the quarry. This bonus increases by +10 every five levels thereafter.

**_Plane Shift_ (Sp):** The agent retriever can use _plane shift_ as a 14th-level caster once per day starting at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.

**_Force Sphere_ (Sp):** The agent retriever gains the ability to call forth a _force sphere._ The agent retriever can attempt to enclose any creature or object he or she can see within 30 feet. The target is allowed a Reflex saving throw (DC 20 + 1/2 the class level of the agent retriever + the agent retriever’s Dexterity modifier). Those who fail are then encapsulated in a sphere of force with a radius of up to 50 feet (the sphere is only as large as it needs to be, up to its maximum radius). Those trapped inside cannot escape except with methods that can bypass or destroy a _wall of force.\_The sphere persists as long as the agent retriever desires, up to a maximum of seven days. A captured target does not count toward the capacity of the agent retriever’s \_plane shift_ ability, and the agent retriever can plane shift with the target despite the presence of the _force sphere._ The agent retriever can use this power once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.

**_Ethereal Jaunt_ (Sp):** The agent retriever can use _ethereal jaunt_ as a 14th-level caster once per day at 4th level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.

**Bonus Feats:** The agent retriever gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat every five levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Epic Endurance, Epic Prowess, Epic Speed, Epic Toughness, Epic Weapon Focus, Fast Healing, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Spell Capacity, Legendary Climber, Legendary Rider, Legendary Tracker, Perfect Health, Permanent Emanation, Spontaneous Spell, Storm of Throws, Swarm of Arrows, and Uncanny Accuracy.

**Enduring Gate (Su):** Starting at 3rd level, as a full-round action, the cosmic descryer can make any casting of the _gate_ spell remain for a full day, rather than disappearing after 1 round per caster level.

The cosmic descryer can draw off excess energy from the multiverse itself to increase his or her effective caster level or enhance any attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check. Drawing off excess energy from the multiverse is dangerous, and it deals the cosmic descryer 5 points of damage for each +1 bonus applied to a single roll or +1 caster level on a single spell.

### Class Features

All the following are features of the divine emissary prestige class.

**Spells per Day/Spells Known:** At each divine emissary level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he or she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spell-caster, the character gains only the benefit noted under the Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a divine emissary, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day.

**Special Mount:** If he or she has one, the divine emissary’s special mount continues to increase in power. Every five levels after 1st, the special mount gains +2 bonus Hit Dice, its natural armor increases by +2, its Strength adjustment increases by +1, and its Intelligence increases by +1. The mount’s spell resistance equals the divine emissary’s class level + the class level that provided the special mount + 5.

**Granted Domain (Ex):** A divine emissary gains access to one of his or her deity’s domains, as well as the granted power of that domain. The extra domain expands a paladin’s selection of spells, but he or she does not gain the ability to cast higher-level spells than he or she otherwise could. Clerics gain an additional domain but otherwise use the rules for preparing spells from their domains normally.

**_Divine Inspiration_ (Sp):** A divine emissary gains a +2 luck bonus on his or her attack and damage rolls for 10 rounds, once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter.

**Extra Smite (Su):** A divine emissary can use his or her smite ability two extra times per day, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter. To determine the damage with any smite attack, a divine emissary adds together his or her divine emissary levels and class levels that originally conferred the smite ability.

**_Greater Planar Ally_ (Sp):** The emissary can call a _greater planar ally_ (as the spell) once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day every ten levels thereafter. The ally does not request a return favor when a divine emissary uses this ability.

**Bonus Feats:** The divine emissary gains a bonus feat at 6th level and an additional bonus feat every ten levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Armor Skin, Devastating Critical, Epic Leadership, Epic Prowess, Epic Reputation, Epic Toughness, Epic Weapon Focus, Great Smiting, Holy Strike, Improved Aura of Courage, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Spell Capacity, Legendary Commander, Legendary Rider, Overwhelming Critical, Perfect Health, Permanent Emanation, Planar Turning, Positive Energy Aura, Spectral Strike, Spontaneous Spell, Widen Aura of Courage.

**Divine Hand (Su):** As a free action, the emissary gains a +20 sacred (or profane if appropriate) bonus on his next melee or ranged attack roll, as long as the attack is made with the deity’s favored weapon. The emissary can use divine hand once per day at 9th level, plus one additional time per day every ten levels thereafter.

## Epic Infiltrator

**Hit Die:** d6.

### Requirements

To qualify to become an epic infiltrator, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

**Alignment:** Any nonchaotic.

**Skills:** Bluff 24 ranks, Diplomacy 10 ranks, Disguise 24 ranks, Spot 10 ranks.

**Feats:** Alertness.

**Epic Feat:** Polyglot.

**Special:** Must have successfully spent one month using the Disguise skill to pose as someone else.

### Class Skills

The epic infiltrator’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Forgery (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), and Spot (Wis).

**Skill Points at Each Level:** 8 + Int modifier.

<table class="half-width-table"><caption>Table: The Epic Infiltrator</caption><tbody><tr><th>Level</th><th>Special</th></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>Improved cover identity (3), sneak attack +1d6</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>Specialist training</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Read thoughts 1/day, <i>mind blank</i> 1/day</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>Far senses 1/day, sneak attack +2d6</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>Specialist training, improved cover identity (4)</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>Far senses 2/day</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>Read thoughts 2/day, sneak attack +3d6</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>Far senses 3/day, specialist training</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>Improved cover identity (5)</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>Far senses 4/day, sneak attack +4d6</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Class Features

The following are class features of the epic infiltrator prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** An epic infiltrator is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all armor, and shields.

**Improved Cover Identity (Ex/Su):** At 1st level, an epic infiltrator establishes three specific cover identities, plus one additional cover identity every four levels thereafter. While operating in a cover identity, the epic infiltra-tor gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks. When the epic infiltrator has the option of adding a new cover identity, he or she may instead work on further perfecting a cover identity already possessed. An improved cover identity grants a +6 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks while operating in that identity. A specific cover identity may be improved multiple times, each time adding +2 to the bonuses. It is impossible to detect the epic infiltrator’s alignment with any form of divination. This ability functions exactly like an _undetectable alignment_ spell, except that it is always active as a supernatural ability. Only divinations are confounded; spells that function only against certain alignments affect the epic infiltrator normally. Should the epic infiltrator wish to “retire” a cover identity and develop a new one, he or she must spend one week practicing the new identity before he or she earns the bonuses. Cover identities do not in themselves provide the epic infiltrator with additional skills, proficiencies, or class features that others might expect of the pretended professions. The epic infiltrator can switch cover identities or don a disguise using the Disguise skill in 1d3 minutes. He or she can also put on or take off armor in one-half the normal time.

**Sneak Attack:** If an epic infiltrator can catch an opponent when the opponent is unable to defend effectively from his or her attack, he or she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the epic infiltrator’s target would be denied his or her Dexterity bonus to AC (whether he or she actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the epic infiltrator’s attack deals +1d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by +1d6 points every three levels. Should the epic infiltrator score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is 30 feet away or less. With a sap or an unarmed strike, the epic infiltrator can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal damage. He or she cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty. An epic infiltrator can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies—undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the epic infiltrator must also be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. The epic infiltrator cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment or by striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If an epic infiltrator gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses to damage stack.

**Specialist Training (Ex):** At 2nd level, the epic infiltrator gains the benefit of focusing his or her craft on a particular type of work, specializing in one of the following categories and receiving a +3 bonus on all checks with the listed skills. Every three levels thereafter, the epic infiltrator gains specialist training again. He or she may select the same category more than once.

_Concealment:_ Bluff, Disguise, and Forgery.

_Subterfuge:_ Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, and Pick Pocket.

_Espionage:_ Listen, Search, and Spot.

_Interaction:_ Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Sense Motive.

**Read Thoughts (Su):** Beginning at 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can _detect thoughts_ as the spell cast by a 15th-level caster, except that it targets a single mind. Every four levels thereafter, the epic infiltrator can per-form this ability one additional time per day.

**Far Senses (Su):** Starting at 4th level, the epic infiltrator can extend his or her vision or hearing into an area beyond his or her normal range, once per day, to a distance of 20 feet plus an additional 20 feet per epic infiltrator level. The epic infiltrator must have personally visited the physical location earlier to use far senses on it. Barriers do not impede far senses, and low-light vision or darkvision function normally if the epic infiltrator has one or both of those abilities. Far senses can also apply to the epic infiltrator’s read thoughts ability. Every two levels beyond 4th the epic infiltrator can perform this ability one additional time per day. This ability functions as the _clairaudience/clairvoyance_ spell cast by a 15th-level caster, except for the limit on range, the need to know the locale beforehand, and the ability to use the read thoughts ability.

**_Mind Blank_ (Sp):** At 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can become immune to all mind-affecting spells and divinations once per day, plus one additional time per day every eight levels thereafter. This ability works as the _mind blank_ spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

## Guardian Paramount

**Hit Die:** d10.

### Requirements

To qualify to become a guardian paramount, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

**Base Attack Bonus:** +15.

**Skills:** Spot 13 ranks.

**Feats:** Alertness, Lightning Reflexes.

**Epic Feats:** Blinding Speed, Superior Initiative.

**Special:** Uncanny dodge, evasion.

### Class Skills

The guardian paramount’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

**Skill Points at Each Level:** 4 + Int modifier.

<table class="half-width-table"><caption>Table: The Guardian Paramount</caption><tbody><tr><th>Level</th><th>Special</th></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>Bonus feat, uncanny dodge enabler 3/day</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>Evasive preceptor 1/day</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>Protective aura</i> 1/day</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>Bonus feat, uncanny dodge enabler 4/day</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>Adjust probability 2/day, evasive preceptor 2/day</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td><i>Call back</i> 1/day, <i>protective aura</i> 2/day</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>Bonus feat, uncanny dodge enabler 5/day</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>Evasive preceptor 3/day, adjust probability 3/day</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>Protective aura</i> 3/day</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>Bonus feat, uncanny dodge enabler 6/day</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Class Features

The following are class features of the guardian paramount prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A guardian paramount is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all armor, and shields.

**Bonus Feats:** The guardian paramount gets a bonus feat at 1st level and an additional bonus feat every three levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Bulwark of Defense, Combat Archery, Damage Reduction, Dexterous Fortitude, Dexterous Will, Epic Dodge, Epic Fortitude, Epic Reflexes, Epic Reputation, Epic Skill Focus, Epic Speed, Epic Toughness, Epic Trapfinding, Epic Will, Exceptional Deflection, Fast Healing, Great Dexterity, Improved Combat Reflexes, Improved Sneak Attack, Improved Spell Resistance, Infinite Deflection, Legendary Climber, Lingering Damage, Mobile Defense, Perfect Health, Reflect Arrows, Self-Concealment, Sneak Attack of Opportunity, Spellcasting Harrier, and Uncanny Accuracy.

**Uncanny Dodge Enabler (Ex):** The guardian paramount must have the uncanny dodge class feature to qualify for the prestige class, so at a minimum the guardian paramount has the extraordinary ability to retain his or her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. It is possible that the character has higher-level aspects of the uncanny dodge ability. Whatever the level of uncanny dodge attained by the character, the guardian paramount can extend the features of his or her uncanny dodge ability to include any one creature he or she designates within 5 feet of him or her (he or she can designate a creature or change designations as a free action once per round). The guardian paramount can extend his or her uncanny dodge ability three times per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter.

**Evasive Preceptor (Ex):** The guardian paramount must have the evasion class feature, which allows the character to take no damage from an area attack with a successful Reflex save. He or she may also have improved evasion, though this is not a prerequisite. The character can extend evasion or improved evasion to include any one creature he or she designates within 5 feet of him or her. The guardian paramount can extend his or her evasion ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter.

**_Protective Aura_ (Sp):** Starting at 3rd level, the guardian paramount can use a special form of _shield other_ once per day, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter. When a guardian paramount creates a _protective aura,\_the transferred wounds are dealt to the guardian paramount as subdual damage, not normal damage, as with the \_shield other_ spell. Otherwise, the guardian paramount’s _protective aura_ functions like the _shield other spell_ cast by an 8th-level cleric.

**Adjust Probability (Ex):** On reaching 5th level, the guardian paramount gains the ability to affect probability twice per day, plus one additional time per day per three levels thereafter. The guardian paramount can force a reroll of one attack roll, check, or saving throw that another creature within 25 feet—friend or enemy—just made. The guardian paramount can find out whether the attack roll, check, or save would have succeeded before using this ability. The recipient must take the second roll, whether it’s better or worse than the original roll. The use of this ability takes place outside the normal initiative order, but the paramount guardian can’t use it if he or she is flat-footed or unable to see the situation resulting in the roll. The guardian paramount must decide whether to reroll as soon as the result of the attack roll, check, or save is known.

**_Call Back_ (Sp):** On reaching 6th level, the guardian paramount gains the ability to return a dead creature that he or she has previously used any of his or her other class abilities on back to life, as if he or she had cast _true resurrection_ as a 20th-level cleric. The character can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day every six levels.

**Skill Points at Each Level:** 2 + Int modifier.

<table class="full-width-table"><caption>Table: The High Proselytizer</caption><tbody><tr><th>Level</th><th>Special</th><th>Spells per Day</th></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td><i>Proselytize</i> 1/day</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><i>Heal</i> 1/day</td><td>+1 level of divine spellcasting class</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><i>Proselytize (deific touch)</i>1/day</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>Bonus feat</td><td>+1 level of divine spellcasting class</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><i>Proselytize (deific word)</i>1/day</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td><i>Heal</i> 2/day</td><td>+1 level of divine spellcasting class</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><i>Proselytize (deific face)</i>1/day</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>Bonus feat</td><td>+1 level of divine spellcasting class</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><i>Proselytize (deific aura)</i>1/day</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td><i>Heal</i> 3/day</td><td>+1 level of divine spellcasting class</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Class Features

The following are class features of the high proselytizer prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** High proselytizers are proficient with all simple weapons, all armor, and all shields.

**Spells per Day:** At every other high proselytizer level, the character gains new spells per day as if he or she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which he or she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster, the character gains only the benefit noted under the Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the character had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a high proselytizer, the player must decide to which class to add each high proselytizer level for the purpose of determining spells per day.

**_Proselytize_ (Sp):** At 1st level, the high proselytizer gains the ability to preach the word of his or her deity to large crowds with great effect. He or she may speak in such a manner once per day, plus one additional time per day per ten class levels thereafter.

_Proselytize_ has three effects. First, any time the high proselytizer is speaking in this manner, he or she is treated as though affected by a _sanctuary_ spell. Second, his or her voice can be heard clearly by anyone within a radius of 100 feet plus 50 feet per class level, regardless of background noise, and his or her speech can be understood as though the audience were affected by a _comprehend languages_ spell. Finally, everyone in the range of the high proselytizer’s voice immediately has a chance of becoming enraptured:

<table data-debug="no-caption" class="full-width-table"><tbody><tr><th>Type of Listener</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>Followers of the same deity</td><td>Automatic if 10 or fewer HD, otherwise Will save (DC 20 + 1/2 high proselytizer’s class level + Wis modifier)</td></tr><tr><td>Others of the same alignment</td><td>Automatic if 5 or fewer HD, otherwise Will save (as above)</td></tr><tr><td>All others</td><td>Will save (as above)</td></tr></tbody></table>

Enraptured audience members act as though affected by a _symbol of persuasion_, changing alignment as appropriate and otherwise functioning according to the _charm person_ spell. The high proselytizer can inspire the crowd to take any of a number of actions, depending on his or her alignment. Any suicidal suggestion grants audience members a new saving throw to break the rapture (with the exception of low-level followers of the same deity, who never got a save in the first place). This rapture lasts for 10 minutes plus an additional 5 minutes per high proselytizer level.

At 3rd level, the high proselytizer’s proselytize ability includes deific touch once per day, plus one additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. During his or her speech, the high proselytizer can move among the enraptured, shaking hands, caressing brows, and otherwise making contact with audience members. Anyone so touched is healed of 1d4 points of damage and cured of any natural disease or poison. Up to six individuals per round can be so affected. An audience member can only benefit from deific touch once per proselytize session. The high proselytizer can use deific touch as long as his or her proselytize ability lasts.

At 5th level, the _proselytize_ ability includes _deific word_ once per day, plus one additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. The words spoken by the high proselytizer can, if he or she chooses, function as a triple-strength _sound burst_ spell (3d8 points of sonic damage and a Will save to avoid being stunned for 3 rounds) to all who are not enraptured, as the spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The _deific word_ can occur at any point during his or her _proselytize_ speech.

At 7th level, the _proselytize_ ability includes _deific face_ once per day, plus one additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. When the high proselytizer speaks, he or she can cause a blinding burst to shine from his or her face. _Deific face_ functions against all in the audience who are not enraptured as the _sunburst_ spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The _deific face_ can occur at any point during his or her speech.

At 9th level, the _proselytize_ ability includes _deific aura_ once per day, plus one additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. When the high proselytizer speaks, he or she can cause a rolling wave of deific power to spring from his or her body that functions as either a _blasphemy, dictum, holy word,_ or _word of chaos_ spell (as appropriate for his or her alignment), affecting only those in the audience who have resisted becoming enraptured. _Deific aura_ otherwise functions as the relevant spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The _deific aura_ can occur at any point during his or her speech.

**_Heal_ (Sp):** At 2nd level, the high proselytizer can use _heal_ on his or herself or another creature once per day, plus one additional time per day per four levels thereafter.

**Bonus Feats:** The high proselytizer gets a bonus feat at 4th level and an additional bonus feat every four levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be chosen from the following list: Armor Skin, Automatic Quicken Spell, Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell, Bonus Domain, Enhance Spell, Epic Reputation, Epic Spell Focus, Epic Spell Penetration, Epic Spellcasting, Epic Will, Extended Life Span, Great Charisma, Great Wisdom, Ignore Material Components, Improved Alignment-Based Casting, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Heighten Spell, Improved Metamagic, Improved Spell Capacity, Intensify Spell, Legendary Commander, Multispell, Negative Energy Burst, Per-manent Emanation, Planar Turning, Polyglot, Positive Energy Aura, Spectral Strike, Spell Stowaway, Spell Opportunity, Spontaneous Domain Access, Spontaneous Spell, Tenacious Magic, Undead Mastery, Zone of Animation.

**Unstoppable (Ex):** At 1st level, the legendary dreadnought can concentrate his or her power, gaining a +20 bonus on his or her Strength check to break or burst a door or item once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. As a special use of this ability, the legendary dreadnought can attempt to break a _wall of force_ (Strength DC 32, and the character applies his or her unstoppable bonus to this check as well). Alternatively, the legendary dreadnought can apply the +20 bonus to a single attack roll.

**Unmovable (Ex):** At 2nd level, the legendary dreadnought can concentrate his or her power, making him or herself unmovable once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. This power grants the character a +20 bonus on any one of the following:

A grapple check made to avoid being grabbed with the improved grab ability.

A Strength check to avoid the effects of a bull rush, trip attempt, or similar effect.

A Strength check against any effect that would move the character either physically or magically.

Any one saving throw. If an effect that would move the character either physically or magically does not normally allow a saving throw, the legendary dreadnought can use this ability to gain a Will saving throw. He or she still gains the +20 bonus on the saving throw in such a case.

**Shrug off Punishment (Ex):** The legendary dreadnought gains 12 bonus hit points at 3rd level and 12 more every five levels thereafter.

**Thick Skinned (Ex):** At 4th level, the legendary dreadnought gains damage reduction 3/–. This does not stack with damage reduction granted by magic items or nonpermanent magical effects, but it does stack with any damage reduction granted by permanent magical effects, class features, the Damage Reduction feat, and this ability itself. The damage reduction improves by 3 points every five levels thereafter

**Bonus Feats:** The legendary dreadnought gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat every five levels thereafter.

**Greater Invisibility (Su):** Starting at 1st level, the perfect wight gains the benefit of _greater invisibility_ once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. The _greater invisibility_ is as the spell cast by a 20th-level caster.

**Improved Legerdemain (Su):** A perfect wight can perform the following class skills at a range of 30 feet: Disable Device, Open Lock, Pick Pocket, and Search. If desired, the perfect wight can take 10 on the check. Any object manipulated during the skill check must weigh 100 pounds or less. Alternatively, the perfect wight can use improved legerdemain to make one melee sneak attack against any creature within 30 feet. The perfect wight executes the sneak attack (or death attack, if applicable) as if attacking from a flanking position. If the attack is successful, the victim is dealt the appropriate sneak attack damage despite the fact that the perfect wight and his or her weapon do not physically cross the intervening distance. A perfect wight can use improved legerdemain once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.

**Incorporeal (Su):** At 3rd level, the perfect wight can become incorporeal once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. A perfect wight can remain incorporeal for a number of rounds equal to 20 + his or her perfect wight level. As an incorporeal creature, the perfect wight can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. He or she is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, the perfect wight has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for force effectsor attacks made with ghost touch weapons). An incorporeal perfect wight has no natural armor but has a deflection bonus equal to his or her Charisma modifier (always at least +1, even if his or her Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus). An incorporeal perfect wight can pass through solid objects at will, but not force effects. His or her attack ignores natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against it. An incorporeal perfect wight moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if he or she doesn’t wish to be. While incorporeal, the perfect wight has no Strength score, so his or her Dexterity modifier applies to both melee and ranged attacks.

**Shadow Form (Su):** At 4th level, the perfect wight can take shadow form once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. The perfect wight’s shadow form lasts 1 minute per level of the prestige class. While in shadow form the perfect wight is incorporeal (see above), is immune to critical hits, and can fly at a speed of 100 feet (good). The perfect wight can also use the substance of his or her own shadow to enhance his or her effective level on any attack roll, check, or saving throw. Drawing power from his or her own shadow form deals the perfect wight 7 points of damage for each +1 bonus on a single roll or +1 effective level for any other single use.

**Bonus Feats:** The perfect wight gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat every five levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Blinding Speed, Combat Archery, Dexterous Fortitude, Dexterous Will, Epic Dodge, Epic Reputation, Epic Skill Focus, Epic Speed, Epic Trapfinding, Improved Combat Reflexes, Improved Sneak Attack, Legendary Climber, Lingering Damage, Self-Concealment, Sneak Attack of Opportunity, Spellcasting Harrier, Superior Initiative, Uncanny Accuracy.
